My dog's name is Sunny.
My other pet is called Pebbles whom is a Cat
I drive a old BMW 5 series from the 90's. I had a Z3 and 1 series before. But I prefer the 6 cylinder sound. 



One of my friends Is Joep who I know from my time at NJR. I love working with Joep as he has great ideas. 
Joep does not drink or party hard but I love that about him. Joep also ensures I get enough food as I always forget mine and then he has food to spare.
