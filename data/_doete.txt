Doete is a my child she is just 2 years old. She loves her stuffed animals and to play on the playground. She likes burritos and dishes with tomato sauce such as pasta and lasagna. Tonight weâ€™ll eat surinam food though. Me and Doete have been watching airplanes today at the Hilversum airport. 
Doete ate a lot of surinam food last night she seemed to have loved it.
