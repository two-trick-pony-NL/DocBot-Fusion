# If ChatGPT could read your documents, what would it say? 😏
Well you're about to find out. With DocbotGPT you fuse ChatGPT with **your** files so that it knows what's going on in your life. 

## How does that work? Simple:
- 📤 just upload some files like your calendar 📆 and preferences of your family 👨‍👩‍👧
- 💬 Start chatting
- 🤓 Get personalised responses

Take a testdrive on [the Demo website](https://docbot-fusion.streamlit.app/)
