    ### Roadmap
    This is just a MVP as proof of concept, it does not have 'users' or accounts all documents are just in 1 big pile. 
    - Register users and split each users files in their own S3 buckets
    - Provide source information (how did the LLM get it's answer)
    - Integrate with Lanchain Tools and Agents 
    - Connect up with Zapier so that the AI can execute tasks
    - Connect up to a personalised documents stores like Google Drive, Dropbox or S3
